# Basics-To-Python
This is just what the name suggest. It is everything I've done on python so far. Have a look
My name is Zarian and this is where I write my first bit of code on GitHub. Its a big moment, me transitioning from noob to apprentice. I love coding and hope to oneday work at GOOGLE and enjoy the rest of my life with the job that I enjoy. :)
